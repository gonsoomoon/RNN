 - For interpretability, implementing attentional RNN.

2.Description
 - Which phrases and words are influential to classify a positive or negative movie review. This paper uses a soft attentional recurrent neural network(RNN) to show interpretability with visualization.

3.Date & Author

 2) Tensorflow 1.0.0
 3) Python 3.6

5.How to run
 1) Download data and source from https://github.com/GokuMohandas/Attentional-Interfaces-O-Reilly/blob/master/attention.ipynb
 2) You need to make an running virtual environment having python3 and tensorflow
 3) Only use data as above and use sources in this folder
 4) main.py is a main entry point source
 5) Commenting out each block, use this command “python3 main.py
